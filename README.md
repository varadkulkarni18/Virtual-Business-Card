# Virtual-Business-Card
This is a simple HTML &amp; CSS project that showcases a Virtual Business Card layout.
Every URL, contact detail, and personal information used in this project is dummy/demo content. They do not represent genuine or active contact details and are simply included for trial and design demonstration reasons.

Please feel free to alter and customize the content as necessary.

 How to Run the Project:

1. Click the green "Code" button above.
2. Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files.
3. Open `business_card.html` in a web browser â€” the CSS will load correctly.

 Do not use the "Raw" download button for just the HTML file, or styles may not load.
